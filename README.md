## Author

My name is Daniel Martinez. I am eager to be given a role as a junior position where I can gain further knowledge and experience.

I demonstrated strong academic performance in database design and management (SQL), object-oriented programming (JAVA) and website development (HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS). The courses I have completed have given me a solid knowledge in the software development area and I have a proven ability to learn challenging concepts quickly.

In addition to this I possess a Bachelor's degree in visual arts and communication that has provided me advanced design skills. I am also able to work within tight deadlines and to develop multiple projects simultaneously; therefore I believe I would be a very strong junior asset to any organization.

If you agree that I would make a valuable addition to your team, please feel free to call me at 07 778 639 835 or email me at danielopq@gmail.com.
